Earlier, the beta version of the app was only available for those who were part of the private beta on TestFlight.Now, it appears that the public beta is available for a wider download. WABetainfo has also shared a link to the official file. However, on the official WhatsApp website, we were still unable to see the new beta versions of the app for download. WhatsApp’s new macOS app: What does it offer?The new macOS app for WhatsApp comes with a totally revamped interface as well. There is a dedicated app sidebar and comes with the ability to drag and drop files as well into the chat.  This is similar to other apps on Mac. WABetainfo does warn that the app is likely to get several new features, given this is still a beta release and not all of the features might work as planned.  The sidebar can be removed as well, depending on user preference. Users have the option of reporting crashes or any other issues to WhatsApp as well given this is still in beta testing."
